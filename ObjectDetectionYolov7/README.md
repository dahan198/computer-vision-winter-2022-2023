# Computer Vision in Surgery course 097222 - HW1

In this assignment, object detection using the [Official YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) 
has been applied on a dataset in the field of computer vision in surgery. 
The goal was to train a model that can accurately classify and detect objects in surgical videos.

In the Exploratory Data Analysis portion of the assignment, 
some images from the dataset were visualized and insights were provided that were gathered 
simply by "looking" at the data.

For the Experiments portion of the assignment, the data was loaded and pre-processed. 
Train and validation loss and mAP (mean average precision) graphs were shown to visualize the performance of 
the model during training. Finally, test results for the model were presented, 
including relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

For the Tool Usage Evaluation portion of the assignment, 
the performance of the YOLOv7 model on a test set of videos was evaluated and metrics such as recall, precision, and F1 
for each class, as well as overall accuracy and F1-macro scores, were presented.
